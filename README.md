### Hey, I'm [Peter PROSPER SENGSAVANG](https://www.peterprosper.com/)! 🖖

I work as a senior developer with playful design skills (interactive designer). I´m based in Paris, France.

Since 2004, I have been browsing for interactive development and creating modern and user-friendly interfaces. I have had the chance to participate in many projects with technical challenges, contributing to make this obscure world accessible to the design expert through code. 🌱

### I have had the opportunity to work with several technologies like 🔨

 - Web Technologie _(ActionScript, Javascript, JQuery, ReactJS, TypeScript)_
 - Arduino / Touch Board by Bare Conductive _(C, C#, Johnny-Five)_
 - Mobile Android & Ios _(Cordova, Ionic, ReactNative)_
 - Unreal Engine / Unity _(C / C#)_
 - Python for Iot _(RaspBerry, esp32 and esp8266, MicroPython, MQTT Protocole)_

### What I'm focusing on 🐱‍👤💻

Currently improving my **[JamStack](https://jamstack.wtf/)** skill with Strapi JS, Gatsby JS and ReactNative.

### My favorite tools 🧰

- Visual Studio Code
