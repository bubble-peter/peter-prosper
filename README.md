### Hi, I'm [Peter PROSPER SENGSAVANG](https://www.peterprosper.com/)! 🖖

I work as a senior developer with playful design skills (interactive designer). I´m based in Paris, France.

Since 2004, I have been browsing for interactive development and creating modern and user-friendly interfaces. I have had the chance to participate in many projects with technical challenges, contributing to make this obscure world accessible to the design expert through code. 🌱

### I have had the opportunity to work with several technologies like 🔨

 - Web Technologie _( ActionScript, Javascript, JQuery, ReactJS, TypeScript, WebGL, ElectronJS )_
 - Arduino / Touch Board by Bare Conductive _( C, C#, Johnny-Five )_
 - Mobile Android & Ios _( ReactNative with Cordova, Expo.io, Ionic )_
 - Unreal Engine / Unity _( C / C# )_
 - Python for Iot _( RaspBerry pi 2,3,4, Esp32 and Esp8266 with MicroPython, MQTT Protocole,... )_

### What I'm focusing on 🐱‍👤💻

Currently improving my **[JamStack](https://jamstack.wtf/)** skill with Strapi JS, Gatsby JS and ReactNative.
I am gradually learning to use **Flutter** from _Google_ 

### My non-exhaustive tool list 🧰

- Visual Studio Code with some useful extensions
- Docker to encapsulate my projects
- NodeJS to make some useful tools I need
- ...
